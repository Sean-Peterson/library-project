title is just title/ also need a copies table that is inputted into when a new title is created (a required field) (total amount of copies). When a patron signs out a book we will then add one to the number of checked out books that title has.

person checks out a single copy of book
and it is recorded (receipt showing) that this patron has this specific book
and when they checked it out and when it is due.
and no one else can check out that specific book.
and it shows how many other copies of that book are in stock in the library.
